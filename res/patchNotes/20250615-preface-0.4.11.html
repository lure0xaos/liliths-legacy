<p>
	For this update, I've been mainly working on merging some pull requests from github, fixing bugs, adding a new random enchantment system (to make randomly-enchanted clothing found in alleyways more exciting), improving item tooltips (with other tooltips in the game to be updated to the new format soon), and a few other small things. As part of the pull requests merged from github, there are now frotting actions in sex (thanks to Sightglass) and many bugs and typos fixed (thanks to Maxis and the several other contributors credited in the patch notes).

	Unless I need to make a hotfix, the next release will be a preview release. I'll make a post on my SubscribeStar and blog detailing my plans within a few days after this version's release (15/06/25).
</p>
<p>
	Thank you so much for your support, and for playing Lilith's Throne! I hope you enjoy the update!
