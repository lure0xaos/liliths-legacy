<h2>v0.4.11.1</h2>

<h3>Image file sizes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The 'res/images/characters' folder has been reduced in size (from ~390MB to ~100MB) by scaling the larger images down to a maximum height of 1080px. If you want the originally-sized images, then you can get them from the github repository.</li>
</ul>

<h3>UI:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed the 'Enchantment instability' text above the inventory UI panel to stop it from wrapping onto a new line if instability was over 99 (the new icon for Enchantment instability should make it clear what the numbers mean anyway).</li>
	<li>Updated the tooltip formatting to align with the new item tooltip formatting for: status effects, perks, combat moves, fetishes, desires, spells, and spell upgrades.</li>
	<li>The 'Items Present' panel is no longer greyed-out when in the inventory screen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added ability to fuck Vronti's ass (unlocked after having previously given him a blowjob or performed anilingus on him).</li>
	<li>Added ability to continue seeing clients in Yui's dungeon scene instead of having the night skip to the end after the first client, and added a random variation for the client's into scene.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sex:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Further refined the condom orgasm behaviour of NPCs, so NPCs wearing condoms will no longer pull out of orifices if the condom is going to break (as they don't know in advance that it's going to break), but if they aren't penetrating an orifice, then they are free to choose an area of their partner to cum onto as the condom breaks.</li>
	<li>Split actions involving tail egg-implanting, so that if a character is penetrating multiple orifices by using multiple ovipositor tails, they now get the option to implant eggs any of the penetrated orifices, instead of the orifice being randomly selected.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Applied tagging to character images so that character artwork which was spread across multiple folders is now all located in one folder (applied to Fae, Silvia, Shadow, Silence, Fyrsia, Hyorlyss, Jess, Lyssieth, Meraxis, Nyan, Leotie, and Takahashi).</li>
	<li>Fennec-morphs no longer need dirty blonde, bleach blonde, or tan fur to be identified as a fennec-morph, and instead just require fennec fox ears.</li>
	<li>Changed Rose's cat-fur colour from black to light red (which was her intended colour as can be seen in her artwork; I didn't realise it was black in-game this whole time...).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Typo and parsing fixes.</li>
	<li>Fixed major bug in sex where sometimes the action buttons would become unresponsive and the game would soft-lock.</li>
	<li>The enchantment instability tooltip should now correctly display when hovering over an NPC's instability count (i.e. the panel directly above their inventory when managing their inventory).</li>
	<li>Fixed parsing errors being thrown if you loaded a save in which slaves had the 'broodmother pills' permission assigned to them.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where you couldn't use a tail ovipositor to lay your eggs in your own womb (surely the biology works somehow...).</li>
	<li>Fixed cause of parsing errors and background errors being thrown when a pregnant character's litter was checked to see if another character was the father, but the litter's father had been removed from the game.</li>
	<li>Fixed error being thrown during sex when performing this sequence of moves: start sex with sealed clothing, unseal & remove that clothing, re-equip that clothing, and then attempt to unseal it again.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the shared encyclopedia was not being applied correctly, and additionally the shared encyclopedia is now updated whenever loading a game (to make sure that all of your discovered items/clothing/weapons/races are added to it).</li>
	<li>The 'On the pill' status effect which Alexandria (the woman in the prologue) has now correctly makes it so that she's unable to get pregnant.</li>
	<li>Scarlett's and Brax's slave collars will no longer have duplicate sealing enchantments.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where NPCs who transform you after sex would constantly try to shrink your breasts and/or crotch-boobs even if your breasts/crotch-boobs were as small as possible.</li>
	<li>Kate will no longer stop you from putting on a condom if she's asleep.</li>
	<li>Added missing tooltip to the 'bar' upgrade for the spa (which was missing only after it was built).</li>
