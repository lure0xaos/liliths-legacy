</ul>

<h3>Engine/Modding:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Character sex preference code is now parsed on each call instead of once when initialised, allowing you to make more complex sex preferences.</li>
	<li>Added 'FITS_BIPEDS' as an item tag to allow clothing to be tagged as only being able to fit bipedal bodies.</li>

	<li>After having sex with Callie once, you can now directly give her donations to progress to the next level of her store upgrades.</li>
	<li>Added a small piece of content for Callie's shop, 'The Creamy Bakey'; if you've completed Natalya's quest, are wearing a filly choker, have performed anilingus on Callie at least once, and have upgraded her shop to the maximum level, then when entering her store you can encounter Natalya in there and have an anilingus-focused threesome.</li>

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
<ul>

	<li>Fixed issue where the doll bad end content would break if you'd previously gained 100 obedience during Murk's bad end content.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where fetish-altering potions which were forced onto you (either after losing to an NPC in combat or after surrendering to them) would apply random fetish effects instead of the targeted ones which the NPC wanted (which was resulting in a never-ending process of fetishes being forced onto you after combat/surrender).</li>
	<li>NPCs who are forcing transformations on the player will no longer try to shrink or grow crotch-boobs if the player doesn't have crotch-boobs.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where a character's default modifiers for milk, cum, and girlcum would always be restored when loading a game, even if they'd previously transformed them away.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where Oglix's elemental, Golix, wouldn't be present during any of her scenes.</li>
	<li>In the fight vs Silence (which occurs if you defeat Shadow before defeating Silence), her elemental will no longer be duplicated.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where resetting your body via the debug menu would unequip all of your piercings.</li>

	<li>Fixed bug in sex where NPCs would sometimes fail to remove their partner's clothing which was blocking access to the sex area they wanted to interact with.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in sex scenes where clothing removals were meant to be restricted, where after changing position the clothing removal restrictions would be lost.</li>
	<li>Text for a character's ass and anus becoming lubricated in sex scenes will no longer be shown if your anal content setting is turned off.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in the occupancy ledger, where filtering slave events by day would sometimes show events that didn't occur during that day (this isn't a retroactive fix, but newly-generated events going forwards will be placed under the correct day within the occupancy ledger).</li>
	<li>The 'Kiss cheek' action is now correctly disabled while immobilised (to bring it in line with the behaviour of other 'loving' actions).</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where offspring you enslaved and transformed into dolls would still be affected by incest, therefore</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where after befriending a randomly-generated NPC, and then enslaving them, they would always use the resisting pace in sex scenes no matter their affection towards you.</li>
	<li>After betraying an NPC, the 'Continue' action is now coloured red like the other removal ones to make it clear that they're about to be removed from the game.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in Nyan's blowjob sex scene, where she could get stuck repeatedly using the 'perform blowjob' sex action, which would make it impossible to end the sex scene.</li>
	<li>When equipping a clothing item which doesn't get removed on equip (such as the new tape items), any hidden enchantments will now be revealed on the underlying item (e.g. the roll of tape) instead of only on the applied item (e.g. the tape in an inventory slot).</li>
	<li>The 'Calming suggestion' and 'Lustful suggestion' sex actions are no longer available if the target is sleeping.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where the 'Arcane storm (protected)' status effect was only applying to interior locations within Dominion.</li>
	<li>You no longer earn Faire tickets from using the buyback menu with Fae & Siliva.</li>
	<li>Stopped background errors from being generated when mousing over an NPC's equipped clothing and weapons while in the buyback menu.</li>
	<li>Fixed several issues with Vronti's sex scenes: incorrect position slots when performing a handjob; being able to swap into slots which were meant to be blocked; the vaginal sex option not being available after performing anilingus.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where if you tried equipping a clothing item which doesn't get removed on equip (such as the new tape items) into a blocked slot, the clothing would be duplicated.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where Fae & Silvia's sex scenes would softlock and throw background errors.</li>
	<li>In the morning oral sex scene with Fae & Silvia (after they sleep over in your room), Silvia no longer starts the sex scene performing cunnilingus if your pussy is blocked.</li>

	<li>The bar upgrade in the spa is no longer missing a description in its information tooltip.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug in sex scenes in which clothing unequipping was meant to be disabled, where you were still able to 'Discard/Drop/Store' the clothing.</li>
	<li>The two tiles within 'The Creamy Bakey' map are now correctly treated as being indoors, and so characters within it are immune to weather effects.</li>
	<li>Fixed inventory rendering issues in light mode.</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where clothing that spawns with the sealing enchantment which costs 5 essences to remove wouldn't stack in the inventory with identical clothing which had had that enchantment removed and then re-added.</li>
