	Hello again, this is just a small hotfix to address two annoying bugs. The more serious of the two major bugs was occurring during sex, where a background error was being thrown and causing the game to softlock. The other bug which I felt needed fixing asap was where the inventory UI would be pushed down and cut off at the bottom of the screen if your enchantment instability attribute was over 99.
</p>
<p>
	There are a few other bug fixes and very small changes in this version. I've also updated the rest of the tooltips to use the new formatting which clothing/items/weapons/tattoos have. Additionally, I've scaled down some of the larger character images, so the download size for this version is a lot smaller than it previously was. If you want the full resolution images, then you can get them from my github.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you so much for your support, and for playing Lilith's Throne! I hope you enjoy the update!
