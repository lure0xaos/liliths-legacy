	Hello again, this is another small hotfix to address one game-breaking bug in sex scenes where if a character has an ovipositor penis or clit and starts an ongoing sex action, the game will lock up. I've also fixed quite a few other bugs, made some minor changes, and added a 'prone bone' sex position. I've also further restricted the slime & elemental transformation options by requiring you to unlock advanced knowledge of a race before being able to transform into them. I've made this change so that I can make sure that certain racial transformations are only going to be available by completing certain content. At the moment this only affects dragons, but I'm going to be adding content involving youko soon, and while it should already be impossible to transform into youko via slime TFs, there might be some races which I add alongside the youko whose availability I'd like to limit.

	I've also added a new 'visual impairment' perk, and although it takes up a few lines in the patch notes, it is just a very small addition to make the in-game glasses have an actual use instead of being purely cosmetic. Although Lilaya, Saellatrix, and Lyssieth wear glasses, they don't have the 'visual impairment' perk (as demon eyes are immune); the only unique NPCs with visual impairment at the moment are Nizhoni, Vanessa (Ms. Cunningham), and Ziva (Ms. Levine).

	I'll now move on to adding main quest content for the next update (which will be a preview one released on my SubscribeStar). I'll make a post at the weekend (of 28/06/25) to let you know how things are going!

	Thank you so much for your support, and for playing Lilith's Throne!
