	The main additions in this version are some new content with Yui and Callie, and a new outfit feature which allows you to quickly purchase and assign custom-made outfits to yourself or any of your slaves. There are also some improvements to slave management (copy & paste settings should remove some tedium when managing lots of slaves), bug fixes, and other minor additions.

<p>
	The next update will be a small one focused on bug fixes, which I hope to have released quite soon after this update.
</p>
<p>
	Thank you all so much for your support and patience, especially after my lack of communication over the past few months. I'm very sorry about how long I left you in the dark for. I'll see you again in the next update!

	<b>Please note:</b> You can transfer your saved games, exported characters, saved enchantments, transformation presets, and outfits from previous versions into new versions simply by copying the contents of your 'data' folder into the new version's 'data' folder!
